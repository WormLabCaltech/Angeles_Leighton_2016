  <h1>Sperm-loss causes entry into the female state, regardless of how sperm is lost</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>How are <em>fog-2</em> and natural sperm depletion related? Formally, there are four
possibilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>fog-2</em> and sperm depletion through time are independent of each other
(they do not affect the same genes at all)</li>
  <li><em>fog-2</em> and sperm depletion have additive effects. They act on the same
phenotype but are otherwise independent of each other.</li>
  <li><em>fog-2</em> and sperm depletion share an epistatic interaction, which means they
act along the same pathways. The combined effect of having a <em>fog-2</em> mutation
and being a 6d old adult is less than expected by additivity.</li>
  <li><em>fog-2</em> and sperm depletion share a synthetic interaction, which means they
act along parallel pathways. The combined effect of having a <em>fog-2</em> mutation
and being a 6d old adult is more than expected by additivity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to explore these possibilities, we decided to first ask whether
these two perturbations were acting on overlapping gene modules. If so, do their
effects have the same sign?</p>

<p>The plots below will help us answer these questions. We have plotted the
biological effect of each variable versus another. Points are colored according
to the logarithm of their q-value. Purple indicates a q-value closer to 0.1,
whereas yellow indicates a q-value $&lt;10^{-20}$.</p>

<h1 id="fog-2-partially-phenocopies-changes-in-expression-due-natural-sperm-depletion"><em>fog-2</em> partially phenocopies changes in expression due natural sperm depletion</h1>

<p>Indeed, the graph below shows that not only do the <em>fog-2</em> transcriptome and the
transcriptome of 6 day old <em>C. elegans</em> act on the same modules, they also share
the same sign!</p>

<p># Changes due to sperm depletion are not additive with changes in expression associated with mutation of <em>fog-2</em></p>

<p>Next we checked whether the interaction coefficient was positively or negatively
correlated with the aging coefficient. A negative correlation indicates that,
on average, mutation of <em>fog-2</em> and aging are epistatic to each other and act
along the same molecular pathways; whereas a positive correlation indicates that
on average mutation of <em>fog-2</em> and aging have a synthetic interaction and they are
acting along parallel pathways.</p>

<p>We can see that the correlation is negative, which indicates that <em>fog-2</em> and
aging are acting along the same molecular pathways.</p>

<p>For completeness, we also show a plot of the genotype coefficient versus the
interaction coefficient. Having seen the plot above, we expect a negative
correlation between genotype and interaction. Indeed, that is what we see.
This evidence suggests that sperm-depletion, whether natural or induced by a
mutation, causes entry into a new <em>C. elegans</em> state.</p>
