Hi, welcome to the main website for our project ['Effects of Life History on the Transcriptomic Phenotypes of Two Genotypes of *C. elegans*'](). This website contains interactive plots of the analysis, and also contains an HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook for our analysis. [Here](https://github.com/WormLabCaltech/Angeles_And_Leighton_2016) is the repository where all of the data is contained.

<!-- TODO: Add link to draft -->
Moreover, an open-access version of our paper can be found [here]().

This website constitutes 100% of the Supplementary Material and Extended Results for our paper.
