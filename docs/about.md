Hi, welcome to the main website for our project
['The *C. elegans* female state:
decoupling the transcriptomic effects of aging and
sperm-status']().
This website contains interactive plots of the analysis, and also contains an
HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook for our analysis.
[Here](https://github.com/WormLabCaltech/Angeles_And_Leighton_2016) is the
repository where all of the data is contained.

<!-- TODO: Add link to draft -->
The BioRxiv version of our paper can be found
[here](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/30/083113).

This website constitutes 100% of the Supplementary Material and Extended Results
for our paper.

### About the authors

#### David Angeles-Albores
David is a graduate student with Paul W Sternberg at Caltech. His research
interests are in genetics, evolution and quantitative biology. For more about
him, visit [his website](https://dangeles.github.io)

#### Daniel Leighton
Daniel is a post-doc with [Leonid Kruglyak](https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/kruglyak/home)
at UCLA, where he does population
genetics research on the variations in metabolism across natural *C. elegans*
populations. He completed his Ph.D. with Paul, where he elucidated an
interesting connection between the fertilization state of a female *C. elegans*
and pheromone production (see the
[paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17905.long)).

#### Tiffany Tsou
Tiffany is an undergrad at UCSB where she is currently majoring in Biology. She
was a SURF at Caltech in 2016, where she was a productive member of the team.
Apart from crowning herself 'Pope of the Nematode Church', she was an
outstanding student and without her this paper would not be possible.

#### Tiffany H. Khaw
Tiffany is an undergrad at Stanford University where she is majoring in
Molecular Biology. She was a SURF at Caltech in 2014, where she was a fantastic
student and crucial in the RNA extraction process for this paper.

#### Igor Antoshechkin

Igor Antoshechkin is the head of the Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and
Genomics Laboratory at Caltech. He was in charge of sequencing and quality
control of the RNA samples.

#### Paul W Sternberg
Paul is Professor of Thomas Hunt Morgan Professor of Biology at Caltech
