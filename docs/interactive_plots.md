Our interactive plots are split into two sections.

* [Volcano Plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/volcano/)

* [Female State]({{ site.baseurl }}/female_state)

The volcano plots show the biological effect of each variable plotted versus
the q-value for each gene. There are three volcano plots, reflecting the
change in expression due to aging from 1st day adult to 6th day adult,
change in expression due to loss of *fog-2* and the interaction terms between
aging and the *fog-2* phenotype.

The plots in the Female State tab show how *fog-2* partially phenocopies the
aging process that worms undergo between the 1st day of adulthood and the 6th
day. Our guess is that this phenocopying is the result of sperm depletion, and
which probably leads to major metabolic and physiologic changes in the worm.
