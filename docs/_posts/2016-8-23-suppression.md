title: egl-9 is suppressed by mutations in hif-1
---

DISCLAIMER: This data is currently unpublished; please don't use it without our express approval!
-----------------------------

Suppression can be observed at the transcriptomic level
-------------------------------------------------------
We investigated the effects of suppression on transcriptomic phenotypes.

Previous research has shown that *egl-9* is a suppressor of *hif-1*.
In classical genetics, making a double mutant of *egl-9; hif-1* should suppress the
*egl* phenotype.
